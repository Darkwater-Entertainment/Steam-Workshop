# Steam-Workshop Addons by Darkwater Entertainment

A curated collection of Garry’s Mod addons from the vaults of **Darkwater Entertainment**, inspired by the **Fallout** franchise and originally created for DarkRP servers.

These addons are designed for use on Garry's Mod servers and can be installed and modified either directly via the Steam Workshop or by cloning and customizing the Lua files locally.

## 🔧 How to Use These Addons

### ✅ Recommended Method (Easiest)
Add the relevant Workshop items to your server via your server’s `collection` or through the Workshop’s in-game or server-side tools. This ensures you automatically get all models, sounds, and materials without extra setup.

### 🧠 Manual Installation & Editing
If you’d like to customize any scripts:
1. Clone or download this GitHub repository.
2. Copy any desired addon folders into your server’s `garrysmod/addons/` directory.
   - Each addon folder should follow this structure:
     ```
     addons/
       your-addon-name/
         lua/
           ...
     ```
3. You can then freely edit the Lua code within your local copy of the addon.

⚠️ Note: You’ll still want to keep the Workshop versions mounted to your server to ensure models, sounds, and other assets load correctly (unless you extract and host those files yourself).
